OrbitCompliance Core is a research environment dedicated to understanding how data-protection analysis must evolve when information is generated, transmitted or transformed through orbital infrastructures. Traditional GDPR instruments were developed for stable, terrestrial systems. Satellite-enabled processing introduces discontinuities in responsibility, geography and legal interpretation that these tools do not fully capture.
The project does not aim to provide an operational toolkit. Its purpose is to examine the foundations of what an “orbit-aware” assessment model should look like, starting from the physics of data movement and extending to the legal architecture that governs it. This repository documents that exploration.

Scope & Roadmap

The scope is intentionally narrow at this stage: to build a structured way of thinking about privacy and risk in orbit-to-cloud data processing. This requires understanding how responsibilities shift along the technical chain, how legal regimes overlap across space, ground and cloud segments, and where existing GDPR frameworks start to lose explanatory power.
The short-term roadmap focuses on stabilising the conceptual framework. The priority is to refine definitions, map processing scenarios with enough precision to be analytically useful, and test the internal coherence of an orbit-aware DPIA through controlled examples. The objective is to identify the essential elements that any assessment model for satellite-enabled data flows must contain.
As the work progresses, the repository will expand to include methodological notes, experimental templates and a small reference library of architectures observed in practice. These documents are working materials rather than deployable tools.
In later phases, once the conceptual scaffolding is stable, the project may develop structured prototypes or early practical implementations. For now, clarity takes precedence over completeness.

Methodological Principles

The project follows guiding principles rather than a fixed methodology. Each principle reflects a structural tension inherent to orbit-linked data processing: technical possibility versus regulatory intent, physical constraints versus legal abstractions, and the need to reconcile all of this with practical expectations of accountability.
The first principle is that any assessment model must be technically grounded. There is no meaningful privacy analysis of satellite systems without an understanding of orbital dynamics, ground-segment dependencies and cloud-side processing logic.
The second principle is jurisdictional neutrality at the structural level, even when examples are contextualised through the GDPR.
The third is falsifiability. Assumptions must be revisable as new systems, analytical capabilities or regulatory interpretations emerge.
The aim is not to settle the debate but to create a framework capable of adapting to a rapidly evolving environment.

Why It Matters

Space-enabled infrastructures are reshaping the circulation of information across borders, networks and legal regimes. Yet privacy and risk-governance tools still assume that data processing happens in conventional, terrestrial contexts. This mismatch affects the accuracy of DPIAs, the allocation of responsibilities across fragmented supply chains and the credibility of compliance in a sector where technical sophistication often outpaces legal certainty.
OrbitCompliance Core is an attempt to address that gap. Its long-term value lies in understanding the problem before designing the tools that may one day operationalise the solution.

Current Status of the Research

The project is in an early, exploratory phase. Core definitions are being refined, the internal logic of an orbit-to-cloud DPIA is being tested on controlled scenarios, and the boundary between technical feasibility and regulatory interpretation is being mapped with care.
Several aspects remain open by design. The distinction between controller and processor roles along the space–ground–cloud chain is being formalised. The scope of legitimate interests in orbital analytics requires targeted examples. The relationship between satellite telemetry, mission data and personal data remains context-dependent.
At this stage, the priority is conceptual clarity. Prototypes and structured methodologies will follow only after the foundational assumptions prove stable.

Repository Structure

The repository reflects the layered nature of the research.
The concepts folder collects core definitions, structural notes and theoretical documents.
The scenarios folder contains controlled examples used to test assumptions about responsibility, risk and data movement.
The models directory includes early sketches of possible assessment structures, none intended for operational deployment.
The references folder compiles relevant regulatory materials, technical documentation and system architectures that inform the analysis.
Additional folders may be added as the research evolves.

Long-Term Vision

The long-term ambition of OrbitCompliance Core is to contribute to a new generation of privacy and risk-governance tools shaped around the realities of space-enabled infrastructures. The objective is not a simple adaptation of existing frameworks but the development of models that reflect how data moves, transforms and accumulates meaning across orbital and terrestrial layers.
If the foundational research proves robust, the project may evolve into a formalised methodology capable of supporting regulators, operators and organisations working with satellite-derived data. This could take the form of a structured assessment model, a technical standard or the groundwork for future automated compliance systems.
Over time, OrbitCompliance Core may also extend into a broader inquiry on the interaction between emerging space technologies, AI-driven analytics and fundamental rights. The ultimate aim is to help define how responsibility and compliance should function in environments where traditional assumptions no longer suffice.
