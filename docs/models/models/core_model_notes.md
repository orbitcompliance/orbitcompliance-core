These notes outline the first structural ideas behind an orbit-to-cloud assessment model.
The goal is simply to sketch the logic that might guide a more formal framework later on.
The initial assumption is that orbit-linked processing requires its own analytical path. Traditional risk and DPIA methodologies describe data flows as if they were static or confined to a single legal space, while satellite systems introduce movement, layered operators, and jurisdictional discontinuities. Any meaningful model needs to engage with these characteristics without reducing them to decorative labels.
At this stage, the work focuses on three elements:
how information travels, which actors effectively control each segment of the processing chain, and how the legal treatment shifts when the data moves from one environment to another. These are working hypotheses and will inevitably evolve once concrete use-cases are examined.
