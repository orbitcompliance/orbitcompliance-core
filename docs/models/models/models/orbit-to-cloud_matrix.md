This document collects early thoughts on how to structure a model that relates orbital segments to cloud-based environments. It is not a matrix yet; it is an attempt to understand which dimensions genuinely matter before translating them into something tabular.
The current intuition is that the model will need to distinguish between physical layers, communication layers, logical control layers, and legal responsibility layers. Whether these dimensions should be merged, separated, or replaced is still an open question. The aim for now is simply to articulate why each layer might be relevant and how it interacts with the others.
