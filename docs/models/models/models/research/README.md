This directory is dedicated to the research backbone of the project.
It hosts working papers, methodological notes, and early-stage analyses that support the conceptual development of OrbitCompliance.
The documents stored here are deliberately exploratory. Their purpose is to refine questions, test assumptions, and identify structural tensions that may later shape the formal model. Nothing here should be read as final; this space exists to think, revise, and rethink.
