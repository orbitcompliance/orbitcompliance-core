Orbit-to-Cloud Data Processing: Notes for a Working Model
These notes sketch the initial direction of a working paper on orbit-to-cloud data processing. The aim is not to produce a finished article but to isolate the conceptual and legal questions that a dedicated DPIA or risk-assessment methodology would need to address.

1. Premise
Satellite-enabled infrastructures move information across radically different environments: orbital, atmospheric, ground-segment, and commercial cloud systems. Each layer introduces its own operators, technical constraints, and cross-border effects. Existing assessment frameworks tend to flatten these differences, treating the entire chain as if it were a typical terrestrial data flow. This simplification hides the actual points where risk and responsibility shift.

2. Initial questions
The research currently revolves around a few open questions:

• How should the model describe the transition between orbital and terrestrial segments without losing sight of legal relevance?
• Which actors effectively determine the purposes and means at each layer?
• How do jurisdictional discontinuities reshape concepts like “transfer”, “supervision”, or “accountability”?
• Which assumptions from traditional DPIAs become unstable once satellite intermediaries are involved?

These questions are not exhaustive; they merely indicate where the conceptual friction is strongest.

3. Working hypotheses
A first hypothesis is that orbit-linked processing is not “exotic”, but simply poorly mapped: the data flow behaves differently because its infrastructure behaves differently. A second hypothesis is that risk cannot be captured through a single continuum; different layers require different analytical tools. A third hypothesis is that responsibility is often distributed across actors who do not fit neatly into controller-processor roles, forcing a more granular approach.

These hypotheses must be tested and, if needed, dismantled through case studies.

4. Next steps
The next stage of the research will focus on selecting concrete scenarios—for example, Earth-imaging chains, navigation services, or satellite IoT connectivity—and analysing how legal responsibilities fragment across the chain. The goal is to use these scenarios to refine or reject the early structure proposed here.

This working paper will evolve gradually as the research deepens.
