This directory gathers the conceptual foundations of the project.
It hosts the first attempts to map what an “orbit-aware” risk or DPIA model might look like, without pretending to be exhaustive or definitive.
The documents stored here are meant to capture reasoning in motion: assumptions, early formulations, and structural ideas that still need to be tested against practical scenarios. Their purpose is to make the underlying logic explicit, not to deliver a final framework.
